# Room In OpenGL (C++)

I have rendered a furnished room in OpenGL. The room has basic furniture like Sofa, Table, Chair, TV, Bookshelf, door, window etc. The program uses model loading. All these furnitures have object files that are either downloaded from open source platforms or designed in blender. The coordinates of these objects are hard-coded. The room also features lightning effect with 4 lights at the roof. One can also use arrow keys for camera movement that is Zoom Out and Zoom In Function. Libraries used are GLEW, GLFW, Assimp and SOIL. 

NOTE: You have to properly set include and libraries folder in visual for project to work properly.
